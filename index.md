## Terminal Documentation

# 1. What is the terminal? Why is it an important tool for a web developer?
The terminal is how developers can access their file system without installing additional software or bloatware

# 2. For you, what are some important built-in commands to know. What do they do, and why are they important? (At least 5)
1. ls: shows the current directory contents so I can visualize and have a better Idea of where I am. 2. cd: used to change current working directory 3. mkdir: make a new directory or folder in the current directory. 4. man: used to display manual for information and commands you can use. 5. rm: used to remove a file from the directory.

# 3. What is the root?
The very top level of the file system. usually represented by '/'

# 4. What is the path?
Path is the location of the file or directory in a system. Either Absolute or relative. Absolute is the exact full path, while relative is the path in relation to another directory or file. 

# 5. What is the present working directory?
the current directory you are located in the terminal. You can use the command 'ls' to see the current working directory contents

# 6. What is the bin? How does it work?
bin is a standard directory for UNIX systems that contains all the common commands like ls, cd, mkdir etc. that can be used anywhere in the file system. It stores the definitions for those commands

# 7. Write about at least two new things you have personally learned about the command line.
I wasnt really sure how the bin worked before researching it for this assignment. I also learned about the common commands rm and man
